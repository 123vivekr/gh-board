The only option seems to follow is use custom contract type eg.\nnew_contract('valid_name', lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0)\n@contract(names='dict(int: (valid_name, int))')\ndef process_accounting(records):\n    ...\n\nThe problem occurring over here is the function name provided to the new_contract method gets the value of the argument implicitly as the one and only argument. Since this doesn't even receive the self or any other kind of variable its impossible to access other objects from inside this method which means we can't populate a class for storing metadata of the acceptable set of values and unless we modify contracts itself or define the acceptable set of values in the function itself. When defining the acceptable values in the function itself it is impossible to access those values outside the method thus defeating the purpose. contracts also follows a strict syntax which makes it impossible to predefine a custom set of methods for each kind of setting in the base classes to which the actual bear can just pass the acceptable values and the setting list to compare against. Everything needs to be implemented in each bear itself. Summing up things like\n[new_contract(i, lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0) for i in in setting_list]\n\nalso doesn't work which makes the code much more difficult to read. The usage of contracts module also provides difficulty when the some default values of the bear setting are assumed in case of the value to the setting is not provided or invalid value is given.\nUsing Type hints provided by python\nThese are pretty much worthless. They can be only used for documentation purposes unless the type checking is performed specially with loading the mypy module which just checks for type hint inconsistencies and doesn't actually run the program. (Haven't tested this out with custom classes). Normal runs of the code don't point out any inconsistencies in invalid types according to type hints.\nWriting code and manual checks for each setting in some way or the other\nThis should be the last resort unless an elegant way is devised. Can be done using decorators or the bear code is itself but a common set of classnames have to be come upon which will be used by all the bears to extract out information about these settings. This can be performed by adding classes to the base class and asking the bear writers to fill them up. Functions can also be made in the base classes to test out settings to automatically provide just the setting and the default values, calling the correct function for the correct setting type and checking whether the value provided is valid or not.","comments":15,"createdAt":"2018-06-10T06:59:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-31T09:37:46Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1531742624000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2533","number":2533,"title":"ESLintBear: KeyError: 'ruleId'","body":"Comand to run\ncoala --files=git-task-list/.eslintrc.js --bears=ESLintBear -V\n\n[WARNING][09:13:51] The default coafile '.coafile' was not found.

The meat of this project is supporting lots of versions of Go, and different BSD, and possible also other more obscure OS like Alpine Linux.\nThe current repology project is about getting 'all' linters linked to Repology.\nI suspect the timeline is not allowing enough time for the process of creating Repology packages for linters that are not yet in Repology, and it seems large numbers of them are missing.  So this will take quite a bit longer than planned.  We'll need to look at various methods of automating the process.  Maybe we rename it to be the 'repology metadata' project.  It will still need to include implementation of the installation routines, but it probably wont have time to solve installation of every bear.

Thus, the full potential of\n+enhanced AST isn't utilized, a whole lot of rework is required to do\n+the basic traversing and collection of important nodes. Pyflakes provides\n+with a basic API that does the traversing. So, if a developer uses enhanced\n+AST he just needs to work on the implementation of the new logic that his/her\n+plugin provides and not about the fidelity of the basic node handlers.\n+\n+**Major tasks of the project:**\n+\n+1. Create a separate repository `coala-pyflakes` to house all\n+   pyflakes based plugins.\n+2. Create package `pyflakes_bears` to hold `PyFlakesASTBear` and all the\n+   coala bears developed using it.\n+3. Create package `pyflakes_generic_plugins` that consists generic plugins\n+   which can be integrated with `flake8` and other such similar wrappers.\n+4. Design and develop `PyFlakesASTBear` that provides helper functions\n+   that can be used to traverse pyflakes AST of the input python module.\n+5. Establish the proof of concept by creating `NoFutureImportBear` that\n+   detects and fixes any usage of `__future__` imports in a python file.\n+6. Add handlers for `ARGS` and `ARGUMENTS` and provide the functionality\n+   of partial code analysis in `pyflakes`.\n+7. Create a `PEP8NamingBear` that detects all pep8 naming violations\n+   in a python file. Special handling is also done to detect violations\n+   in doctests which other similar plugins fail to perform.\n+8.

Thus, the full potential of\n+enhanced AST isn't utilized, a whole lot of rework is required to do\n+the basic traversing and collection of important nodes. Pyflakes provides\n+with a basic API that does the traversing. So, if a developer uses enhanced\n+AST he just needs to work on the implementation of the new logic that his/her\n+plugin provides and not about the fidelity of the basic node handlers.\n+\n+**Major tasks of the project:**\n+\n+1. Create a separate repository `coala-pyflakes` to house all\n+   pyflakes based plugins.\n+2. Create package `pyflakes_bears` to hold `PyFlakesASTBear` and all the\n+   coala bears developed using it.\n+3. Create package `pyflakes_generic_plugins` that consists generic plugins\n+   which can be integrated with `flake8` and other such similar wrappers.\n+4. Design and develop `PyFlakesASTBear` that provides helper functions\n+   that can be used to traverse pyflakes AST of the input python module.\n+5. Establish the proof of concept by creating `NoFutureImportBear` that\n+   detects and fixes any usage of `__future__` imports in a python file.\n+6. Add handlers for `ARGS` and `ARGUMENTS` and provide the functionality\n+   of partial code analysis in `pyflakes`.\n+7. Create a `PEP8NamingBear` that detects all pep8 naming violations\n+   in a python file. Special handling is also done to detect violations\n+   in doctests which other similar plugins fail to perform.\n+8. Create a `BuiltinsBear` that is capable of detecting redefinition\n+   of python builtins in a file.\n+\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+The challenge of the project was to implement the `PyFlakesASTBear` in\n+such a way that a plugin developer need not worry about writing his own\n+traversing logic and need to have much no more than the knowledge of\n+PyFlakesASTBear nodes to write the bears. However, designing the logic\n+first by writing cEP(coala enhancement proposal) for\n+[coala-pyflakes](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0025.md) helped\n+me a lot to understand the problem to a deep level and come out with a logic\n+to tackle it.\n+\n+#### Future prospects of the projects\n+\n+With `PyFlakesASTBear` ready bear developers can use it to detect codesmells","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-08-09T15:37:50Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-09T15:37:50Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTAyMjkzMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/614#discussion_r209022933","bodyText":"Use quotes or : will be treated as defining yaml variable","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,305 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/macbox7\n+student: Ankit Joshi\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link: https://coala.io\n+project: Integrate pyflakes-enhanced AST into coala\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5549789140221952\n+tarball: https://rawgit.com/MacBox7/GSoC-Report/master/project.tar.gz\n+mentors: >\n+ [John Vandenberg](https://github.com/jayvdb) & [Adhika Setya Pramudita](https://github.com/adhikasp) & [Steven Myint](https://github.com/myint)\n+\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/8\n+ - Phase 1 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/25\n+ - Phase 2 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/26\n+ - Phase 3 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/27\n+\n+bio: >\n+  A senior student at National Institute Of Technology, Kurukshetra major\n+  in Information Technology.

Debugger Interface added in coala.\n+   1. Step into the `run()` method of a bear move through it using a debugger\n+      interface such as `pdb` and exits as soon as `run()` is left.\n+   2. Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2. A new command `settings` is included in coala's Debugging Interface to\n+   inspect Bear settings in the debugging environment. It displays all passed\n+   settings of a Bear and their values so bear developer can quickly inspect\n+   them.\n+\n+3. Profiler Interface added in coala.\n+   1. The profiler will start by profiling the `run()` method of bears because\n+      this is the part where bear writers will spend time on, as rest of the\n+      part like loading the files, collecting the settings, etc. are done by\n+      coala itself.\n+   2. `--profile-bears` or `profile_bears` (using .coafile) is the main argument\n+      to enable profiling.\n+   3. Accept an additional parameter `directory_path` through which bear\n+      developers can specify where to store the profiled data files.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with testing of Debugger interface. With the help of `Mock`,\n+test for debugger interface was created, though code coverage was 100% but\n+`mock` test was not the ideal test, so after hours of discussion with Mischa we\n+decided to capture the `pdb stdout` and assert the the output with the real\n+output but problem arised, the ideal tests passes but somehow it didn't showed\n+the code coverage to 100% not only that it was also removing the coverage of\n+the previous tests, at first I thought created test have some problem but seems\n+like `pytest-cov` had a problem, so to confirm that I created a\n+[test repo](https://github.com/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) and enable the\n+[CI](https://travis-ci.org/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) on that repo to check the\n+coverage response, it also showed same failure.

Debugger Interface added in coala.\n+   1. Step into the `run()` method of a bear move through it using a debugger\n+      interface such as `pdb` and exits as soon as `run()` is left.\n+   2. Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2. A new command `settings` is included in coala's Debugging Interface to\n+   inspect Bear settings in the debugging environment. It displays all passed\n+   settings of a Bear and their values so bear developer can quickly inspect\n+   them.\n+\n+3. Profiler Interface added in coala.\n+   1. The profiler will start by profiling the `run()` method of bears because\n+      this is the part where bear writers will spend time on, as rest of the\n+      part like loading the files, collecting the settings, etc. are done by\n+      coala itself.\n+   2. `--profile-bears` or `profile_bears` (using .coafile) is the main argument\n+      to enable profiling.\n+   3. Accept an additional parameter `directory_path` through which bear\n+      developers can specify where to store the profiled data files.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with testing of Debugger interface. With the help of `Mock`,\n+test for debugger interface was created, though code coverage was 100% but\n+`mock` test was not the ideal test, so after hours of discussion with Mischa we\n+decided to capture the `pdb stdout` and assert the the output with the real\n+output but problem arised, the ideal tests passes but somehow it didn't showed\n+the code coverage to 100% not only that it was also removing the coverage of\n+the previous tests, at first I thought created test have some problem but seems\n+like `pytest-cov` had a problem, so to confirm that I created a\n+[test repo](https://github.com/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) and enable the\n+[CI](https://travis-ci.org/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) on that repo to check the\n+coverage response, it also showed same failure. So, we first created a issue on\n+`pytest-cov` repo, but actual problem was both coverage and debugger use the\n+same trace feature, so it was not possible to run coverage and debugger in\n+parallel or say it is not possible to chain the trace functions, so Mischa gave\n+a idea to restore the trace callbacks and then run test and finally it worked\n+so I included both ideal and `Mock` test so that the coverage remain 100, but\n+in all of these I lagged 3-4 week from my schedule.

Auto review of Fixes vs closes keywords in a Pull request.\n+   4. Auto reject pull requests opened on specified branches.\n+   5. Squash commits in a Pull Request.\n+   6. Request assignment to an issue.\n+\n+2. Add WIP label and remove pending review label if coala plugin finds defects\n+   in a Pull Request.\n+3. IGitt enhancements:\n+   1. Filter issues by label, assignee in a repository.\n+   2. Fetch user id from username in GitLabUser.\n+   3. Added issues property and filter_issues method in Organization class.\n+   4. Added fix_issues, close_issues, resolve_issues properties in\n+      PullRequest.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with implementing GitLab API in IGitt. GitHub has teams and\n+GitLab API doesn't support teams, so I had to re-design assign request plugin\n+to work without teams. Similarly, GitLab API doesn't have any webhook for pull\n+request review event, so I couldn't implement one of the proposed features.","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-08-03T10:13:50Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-03T10:13:50Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwNzg4MTE2OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/607#discussion_r207881168","bodyText":"GitMate labelling PR as per review done by maintainer.","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,169 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/VamshiKrishna\n+student: Vamshi Krishna Bommerla\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link : https://coala.io\n+project: Implement Gitmate automations and plugins for coala\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5344316227059712\n+tarball: https://rawgit.com/Vamshi99/GSoCReport/master/project.tar\n+mentors: >\n+ [Naveen Kumar Sangi](https://github.com/nkprince007),\n+ [Lasse Schuirmann](https://github.com/sils),\n+ [Manvendra Singh](https://github.com/manu-chroma),\n+ [Hizkia Felix](https://github.com/HizkiFW)\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/4\n+ - Phase 1 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/5\n+ - Phase 2 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/6\n+ - Phase 3 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/7\n+bio: >\n+ I am third year student of B.Tech Computer Science Engineering at Amrita\n+ University, Amritapuri, Kerala.

I also implemented a assign request plugin to assign\n+ issues to a user if he/she satisfies defined eligibilty conditions.\n+social:\n+ - GitHub:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://github.com/Vamshi99\n+ - GitLab:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/Vamshi99\n+ - Gitter:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitter.im/Vamshi99\n+email: bommvams72@gmail.com\n+blog: https://vamshi99.blogspot.com\n+activity:\n+ - 0:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/225a88e695794535f50996b4997466b72e9d47ea\n+   - details: >\n+      Add gitmate pr rejector plugin\n+ - 2:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/847afeb5460ce2866ecb2cc38593c0c486aa0271\n+   - details: >\n+      Commit.py: Add mentioned_issues, closes_issues propeties\n+ - 3:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/05062b4f9758068291445f87469e4d9d2a4f9707\n+   - details: >\n+      Upgrade IGitt\n+ - 4:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/3d2164d71722e55a6432a8911149c64897851564\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Fixes vs Closes automated checking plugin\n+ - 5:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/4a044453f5d34c9f1b8227b7f57b8a0fd0caba57\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest.py: Add fix_issues, close_issues, resolve_issues properties\n+ - 6:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ffd554de617d619809f11b0284eaa032c2d9df83\n+   - details: >\n+      Auto assign issue based on commit mention in PR\n+ - 7:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/0eec2ec32e7afd7d017cad4c67a741c688e1bfc4\n+   - details: >\n+      apps.py: Add helper function to fetch plugin settings\n+ - 8:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/e2224d7d1f61a34065f741535e53e676dc51ff4b\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Team class\n+ - 9:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/f9d08c9a88c0b958a4c2ec5eb813fcd124b5300e\n+   - details: >\n+      Mark PR as WIP if coala plugin detects errors\n+ - 10:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c4abdd4f9367af8ce73f39f525383def68de6b62\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest: Add mergeable property\n+ - 11:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/db76142d3ecb1e6cd9cd10885ae2475cb07c4d3d\n+   - details: >\n+      Notify merge conflicts in a PR\n+ - 12:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ad5480c9b0a124d98020a4ad3fd3caf20fa1e321\n+   - details: >\n+      pr_rejector: Support regex in branch names\n+ - 13:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/94735ff0f1024d6f293db90516087d8e4d2c353d\n+   - details: >\n+      Organization: Add issues property and filter_issues method\n+ - 14:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/fff0d568f1f2731c5055995ff19bbc93be842d5f\n+   - details: >\n+      Repository: Filter issues by label, assignee\n+ - 15:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c025311167b07da5e825433a4d4d5e376adfed62\n+   - details: >\n+      GitLabUser: Fetch user id from username\n+ - 16:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/fad8305823a1058e93cd2397b5239a882b66c3f9\n+   - details: >\n+      Add squash pull request command\n+ - 17:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/3124c07ca5cd46acf985dc25fe22889e5a4744d0\n+   - details: >\n+      Dockerfile: Install requirements\n+ - 18:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/68360f3f0fac686907c7eb44c1a70bfa9e276d42\n+   - details: >\n+      run.py: Update squash command\n+ - 19:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/dda98a8ab67d01376d3199bb82260838cebab7b0\n+   - details: >\n+      rebaser: Add squash command\n+ - 20:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/f4ec3c602745bcf08405479a684876cc1080a21f\n+   - details: >\n+      Issue: Add available_assignees property\n+ - 21:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/merge_requests/525\n+   - details: >\n+      Add assign request command\n+ - 22:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/merge_requests/524\n+   - details: >\n+      Add review plugin\n+---\n+\n+### Implement Gitmate automations and plugins for coala\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+1. New Plugins added in GitMate:\n+   1. Auto-assign issue based on commit mention in a Pull Request.\n+   2. Notify merge conflicts in a Pull Request.\n+   3. Auto review of Fixes vs closes keywords in a Pull request.\n+   4. Auto reject pull requests opened on specified branches.\n+   5. Squash commits in a Pull Request.\n+   6. Request assignment to an issue.\n+2. Add WIP label and remove pending review label if coala plugin finds defects\n+   in a Pull Request.\n+3. IGitt enhancements:\n+   1. Filter issues by label, assignee in a repository.\n+   2. Fetch user id from username in GitLabUser.\n+   3. Added issues property and filter_issues method in Organization class.\n+   4. Added fix_issues, close_issues, resolve_issues properties in\n+      PullRequest.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with implementing GitLab API in IGitt. GitHub has teams and\n+GitLab API doesn't support teams, so I had to re-design assign request plugin\n+to work without teams. Similarly, GitLab API doesn't have any webhook for pull\n+request review event, so I couldn't implement a feature in GitMate\n+which labels pull request as per review done by maintainer.\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+1.

Then community repo gets that list, and only fetches data about them\n\"newcomers active in the last three months\" could be a simple algorithm to start with\nThe hard part is defining 'active' -- MRs updated could be a bot, but the newcomer has long disappeared, so we should exclude those bot actions. I'm not sure if we have a better way of identifying activity... ?","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNzEzMjQyMA==","createdAt":"2018-07-29T14:39:37Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"sks444","name":"Shrikrishna Singh"}}],"createdAt":"2018-07-28T18:35:43Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-07-28T18:35:43Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"community","updatedAtMs":1532864240000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/138","number":138,"title":"Add teams to Contributor model","body":"Closes #137","comments":14,"createdAt":"2018-05-28T02:40:23Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-29T11:37:20Z","closedAt":"2018-07-29T11:37:11Z","state":"merged","user":{"login":"sks444","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22263040?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"sks444","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22263040?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"process/pending review","color":"ededed"},{"name":"size/XS","color":"ededed"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/138","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDE5MTY1MzAwOQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/138#discussion_r191653009","bodyText":"I see that you created another Model called Team in https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/blob/86203d6a9b5b840bc851804858744a4281240286/backend/org/models.py and use teams = models.ManyToManyField(Team) in Contributor model.
